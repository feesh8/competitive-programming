# My solutions to Kattis problems

This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems from the [Kattis platform](https://open.kattis.com/problems). These solutions are mainly in Python.

## Description

Solving these problems was a preparation for SWERC 2022-2023 in Milan. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem and contains the source code of my solution.
